## About

I’m a developer who enjoys working close to **systems, tooling, and automation**.
I like solving problems where structure, maintainability, and long-term usability matter more than quick wins.

My work often sits at the intersection of:

* Developer experience (DX)
* Automation and frameworks
* System-level workflows
* Practical use of AI to assist developers

---

## Skills & Interests

**Languages**

* Python
* C / C++
* Java
* JavaScript
* Shell scripting

**What I Work On**

* Developer tools and CLI utilities
* Code parsing and generation systems
* Backend utilities and dashboards
* Cross-platform (Linux / Windows) automation
* Test frameworks and build pipelines

**AI Enthusiast (Practical, Not Hype)**

* Using AI to assist debugging and tooling
* Exploring AI-assisted code generation
* Productivity-focused AI workflows
* Interested in where AI *actually* helps engineers

---

## Selected Work

Across my repositories you’ll find:

* Python packages for debugging and automation
* System reporting and monitoring dashboards
* Windows log and crash collection tools
* C/C++ header and source generation frameworks
* Template-driven test case generation
* CLI-based visual and loader experiments

I prefer building foundations that can be extended rather than one-off scripts.

## Fun (But True)

```text
build → break → understand → rebuild (better)
```

* Enjoys terminal aesthetics and clean CLIs
* Likes digging into edge cases and internals
* Prefers boring, reliable solutions over clever hacks
* Believes good tools should feel obvious to use

---

## Current Focus

* Polished, maintainable Python packages
* Framework-level automation
* Developer productivity tooling
* AI-assisted workflows that save real time
* Cross-platform engineering problems
