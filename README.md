Software developer focused on building practical tools, automation frameworks, and system-level utilities.

## About

I enjoy working on problems where code needs to scale in **complexity and longevity**, not just features.
Most of my work revolves around:

* Developer tooling and automation
* Python-based frameworks and utilities
* C/C++ code generation and system-level workflows
* Cross-platform (Linux / Windows) projects

I prefer building **frameworks over scripts** and tools that can evolve over time.
