## About

I’m a developer who enjoys working close to **systems, tooling, and automation**.
I like problems where structure, maintainability, and long-term usability matter more than quick wins.

I mostly work at the intersection of:

* 🧩 Developer experience and tooling
* ⚙️ Automation and reusable frameworks
* 🧠 Practical applications of AI in engineering

---

## Skills & Interests

**Languages**

* 🐍 Python
* ⚙️ C / C++
* ☕ Java
* 🌐 JavaScript
* 🖥️ Shell scripting

**What I Build**

* Developer tools and CLI utilities
* Code parsing and generation systems
* Backend utilities and dashboards
* Cross-platform (Linux / Windows) automation
* Test frameworks and build pipelines

**AI Enthusiast (Practical Focus)**

* 🤖 AI-assisted debugging and tooling
* 🧠 AI-driven code generation experiments
* ⏱️ Productivity-focused AI workflows

---

## Selected Work

Across my repositories you’ll find:

* 🧪 Python packages for debugging and automation
* 📊 System reporting and monitoring dashboards
* 🪟 Windows log and crash collection tools
* ⚙️ C/C++ header and source generation frameworks
* 🧩 Template-driven test case generation
* 🎮 CLI-based visual and loader experiments

I prefer building foundations that can grow instead of one-off scripts.

## Fun (But True)

```text
build → break → understand → rebuild (better)
```

* ✨ Enjoys terminal aesthetics and clean CLIs
* 🔍 Likes digging into edge cases and internals
* 🧱 Prefers boring, reliable solutions over clever hacks
* 🎯 Believes good tools should feel obvious to use

---

## Current Focus

* 🚀 Polished, maintainable Python packages
* 🧩 Framework-level automation
* 🧠 Developer productivity tooling
* 🤖 AI-assisted workflows that save real time
* 🌍 Cross-platform engineering problems
